Highlights

- Low-dimensional codes constrain high-dimensional coupled dynamical systems
- Code bandwidth systematically controls responding system's behavioral complexity
- Random projections of same dimensionality fail to induce complexity collapse
- Constraining codes must capture coherent macroscopic degrees of freedom
- Provides mechanism for ubiquitous low-dimensional biological coding structures
